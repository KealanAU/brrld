162,Mavericks (Half Moon Bay),San Mateo County - South,Central California,"California, Central",37.4924,-122.501,America/Los_Angeles,"One of the seven natural wonders of the world, Maverick's is that rarest of things: not just a perfect wave and not just a giant wave but a perfect, giant wave. The peak lies a little less than a half-mile off of Pillar Point and is marked by a clump of Stonehenge-like boulders lining the inside (two of these boulders have even been christened: Mushroom Rock on the south end and Sail Rock on the north). Massive swells looming out of the deep approach a shelf - made up of black, ungodly reef and boulders 20-feet beneath the surface - at breakneck speeds. From there, Maverick's becomes a 20-foot version of Stockton Avenue: a perfect, jacking AAA-frame breaking both ways, the right going long and the left a short-lived explosion of hell and spitfire.The hot spots on the Maverick's playing field are as follows: 1. Outer Bowl: On the biggest of days (20 feet at 20 seconds and beyond on the Half Moon Bay buoy), there's a takeoff spot about 100 yards out beyond Maverick's proper. Few waves have been caught here, but all of them have been memorable; 2. The Corner: This is the peak on the extreme north end of the break that, if surfers time it right and choose the right one, allows them to get into the wave and down the face. Since it's the deepest takeoff point for the rights, it's often regarded as the triple-diamond takeoff zone; 3. Lates Bowl: This is an overflow section on the south end that occasionally serves up the rogue monster. When a big set shifts wide of the Corner, it usually breaks on Lates Bowl; 4. The Cauldron: Just inside the Corner, there's a wicked set of boils to be avoided at all costs. This is the focal point for the majority of Maverick's wrath and is the spot where most two-wave hold-downs happen. Strange phenomena -- whirlpools, undertows that suck people into the abyss, etc. -- have been known to take place at the Cauldron.",Advanced,Advanced,Intimidating,It exists.

Because Santa Cruz faces straight south, Lighthouse Point points almost directly south, and that weird geography is the secret to Steamer Lane’s success. Swells from the west and northwest that ravage the coast north of Santa Cruz are evened out and groomed as they bend into the Monterey Bay. The same is true for the northwest winds that pound the north coast for most of the year. Because of the bend at the top of the Monterey Bay, those northwest winds blow offshore at Steamer Lane. There are few things in nature as beautiful as a 10-foot, offshore peak unloading at Steamer Lane. Steamer Lane is maybe a little too irresistible, because it is now one of the most crowded surf spots in California.

The water detonates onto the shallow sand bank in a steep and pitching lunge, and although it is sand-bottomed, from here on in it breaks like a reef. Those who hit the bottom do so hard. The outer peak is dominated by a pack, but even the scraps way down the line can offer great barrels. Mundaka's fantastically shaped rivermouth sandbar creates solid, 200-yard-long, top-to-bottom barrels. The rip that runs along the side of the cliff is perhaps surfing's ultimate saltwatery escalator -- it's a paddle-optional trip straight to the peak. Mundaka's essentially a 200-yard-long shorebreak wave. It gulps and warbles and barrels top-to-bottom like the best inside beachbreak ever and keeps going.

Along this massive sandy stretch, the lava headland of Burleigh Bluff stands forth as the northernmost sentinel of a classic series of right points, and -- when it's on -- one of the most spectacularly beautiful waves in the world. Burleigh relies on sand flow from the Tallebudgera Creek mouth just south of the bluff. This fine river sand is carried with the prevailing currents around the front of the bluff and down its rocky, north-facing edge in a long, thin shallow band. It's not always a consistent band; for months, Burleigh can be reduced to a closed-out mess by bad sand distribution. But more often than not, the sand line is relatively straight and laid on a perfect angle for any swell with a hint of southerly angle. Imagine a super-hollow, warm-water version of Rincon and you're almost there, though comparisons don't do justice to Burleigh's glassed-off sucking marvel.There's several distinct sections. Outside you'll find Sharkies, the aptly named first section, breaking across the front of the bluff; thick, hollow and often closing out down to the bowling pits at The Cove, where Burleigh point begins to curve back toward the beach. The Cove's stand up barreling peaks run 80 yards or so down to The Point, where Burleigh's legends reside; The Point is a long-walling ride spinning along the fine sandbar edge, where on a reasonably good day, five to 10-second tubes are harvested with almost every passing set. Inside The Point, right along the bluff's rim, lies Rockbreak, a shorter wave, best at high tide and ridden mostly on smaller days -- chest-high and less -- when The Point is just capping, not funneling. Rockbreak is so named after the slimy basalt boulders over which it bumps and grinds. Very occasionally, The Point's sand line drifts right into Rockbreak, forming a disgustingly epic 150-yard-plus roping barrel.Many pleasant beachbreaks surround Burleigh, including the often super-fun peaks along Palm Beach, south of Tallebudgera Creek, and toward Nobbys headland north of the point. Go south beyond Palmy and you'll come across the coast's best kept non-secret, Currumbin Alley, a lovely rivermouth right sandbar and focus of huge tow-in activity during rare giant swells.",Intermediate - advanced,Intermediate to advanced,Intimidating,Freakin' intense when it's pumping.,Heavy,Insanely packed.,Perfect,One of the best spots in Oz.,Exhausting,Strong.,Clean,Clean most of the time,"Barrels that break top-to-bottom over shallow water, the surprise rock, insane crowds, insane locals.",Straight from the point parking lot.,"Shortboard, funboard, longboard, fish",Sand/rocks,Year-round

The winds are dynamic, but the real factor is the tide. All that water moving in and out of the Golden Gate sweeps up and down Ocean Beach with enough force to dislocate swell and shift sandbars from hour to hour. Ocean Beach has many, many moods, from the manic ecstasy of clear, blue offshore fall days to the gloom and doom of stormy winter, windy spring and gray summer. There is no stretch of ocean in California that changes as much from hour to hour, day to day and season to season as Ocean Beach.When Ocean Beach is on, you will see three miles of shifting, meaty, dark-green offshore peaks, from head-high to triple-overhead, cannonading the surf zone from south, west and north. A perfect day at Ocean Beach can be a mind-boggling sight, a mile after mile of perfect surf, with scattered humans doing their best to paddle through the impact zone, make it out the back and catch one of the buggers.On a lot of days at Ocean Beach, just getting out can be a major accomplishment. Depending on swell and tide and sandbar, on many days there is a 200-yard ""zone of death"" in between the beach and the lineup. It can be as hard to get off the beach and out to sea for a surfer as it was for a marine to get from sea to shore on the beaches of Normandy. It takes knowledge, skill, strength and courage, but the deciding factor on a lot of days is still dumb luck.Make it outside, and there are rewards, but your troubles aren't necessarily over. A good day at Ocean Beach is as good as any beachbreak in the world, but the good peaks here have a maddening quality of always being 50 yards away from where you're sitting. Even good surfers who surf the place all the time will get skunked, catching maybe one or two waves an hour, while paddling back and forth, trying to hunt down the big, shifting beasts.Ocean Beach is bordered by Kelly's Cove on the north end and Sloat Street on the south end. In between are three miles of beachbreaks, which become emptier and lonelier from north to south. There is lots parking from Kelly's Cove down to VFW's in front of Golden Gate Park.

Just offshore, hidden under all that water, the Monterey Canyon drops down to a maximum depth of over a mile, and the Canyon has an effect on what happens along the beach. The swell that hits Moss Landing has come out of very, very deep water and hasn't been slowed down by the continental shelf. The result is a very powerful, often frustrating, beachbreak. It can be almost impossible to get out at Moss Landing, and there is always the possibility of getting hammered by a triple-overhead wave.In the winter, Moss Landing is a very serious surf spot -- big, powerful and challenging.

Frequent, heavy NW winds plague the north coast, so it's wise to hit it early or not at all. Early-morning offshores can be freezing. Considerably bigger and much more exposed than the county's relatively tame south coast, Jalama packs a mean punch, summer or winter, so you can expect truckloads of juice out here if the swell's pumping.A primo SW swell area and the northernmost portal for surfing in Santa Barbara County, Jalama Beach County Park has three recognized surf spots: the Beachbreak, Cracks and Tarantulas (or T's for short).The Beachbreak extends from the campground area down to Cracks, which is distinguished by a large indentation in the bluffs. It's all shifty, semi-hollow sandbars, best on a high tide with clean, peaky swells. Cracks holds size, but getting out becomes a problem (or outright impossibility). The currents can be bad, too. Cracks is a good place to go if the swell's too small for Tarantulas. Primarily a left, the rights at Tarantulas can also get quite good, peeling fast for a ways into the boulder-strewn inside. The lefts are perfect for lip-smacking and roundhousing, with a comfy channel for easy paddles and time-outs. The shape is much more consistent than that of the Beachbreak area, so the jog down to T's is usually well worth the effort.

Here we go again -- the dreaded surf media's shameless exploitation of SoCal's secret little jewel. Well, not exactly. Due to years of saturated bickering and ballyhoo regarding the coveted Hollister and Bixby ranch reefs and points, we've decided here to simply offer an overview, touch briefly on the access clause, then leave the rest up to you.What The Ranch surfing tug-of-war essentially boils down to is this: throughout the '60s, The Ranch was solely ruled and regulated by members of the Santa Barbara County Surfing Association. When the Hollister Ranch was subdivided in the early '70s, affluent surfers swarmed in and purchased parcels. It didn't take long for them to believe it was (and still is) their God-given, exclusive right to surf The Ranch by themselves or with some friends.What ensued is the standard selfish surfer mind-set that runs rampant throughout the world, despite the fact that certain places like The Ranch were long ago exposed and are hardly something to pretend doesn't exist. Granted, The Ranch would be one of the most crowded spots in California if it weren't for the requisite $75,000 parking pass, unless you consider how fickle and inconsistent the reefs actually are. Because of its due-south exposure and Channel Islands partial shadow, swells usually hit smaller at The Ranch and tend to be highly tide sensitive. Yes, spots like Razorblades, Little Drakes, Rights and Lefts and Cojo offer spurts of perfection on any given day, but if you don't already known this, it's probably not worth worrying about now. Because the fact is, it ain't a whole lot of fun if you aren't one of the in-crowd.Much to the ""owners'"" chagrin, they don't get to surf alone at The Ranch. The numbers of wave-hunters who boat up are seemingly infinite, launching their inflatables from the beach at Gaviota if the pier winch is broken (and it often is thanks to cooperative Ranch hounds). If you do pull up at one of the headliner breaks in an inflatable, chances are you will be either glared at or told to split. And watch out for the kamikaze Ranch local in scuba gear who specializes in pulling anchors.Nonetheless, The Ranch remains a magical fetch of coast, perched just above the urban sprawl of Southern California, and it's little wonder why so many people are fanatic about preserving the integrity of what once embodied the greater Southern California coast before the blitz of people, bulldozers and concrete.",Intermediate - advanced,Intermediate to advanced,Intimidating,Hostile.,Mellow,Hostile at the premier spots with land access for parcel owners.,Perfect,Quirky perfection in old California.,Medium,Manageable unless a local cuts your anchor line.,Clean,Clean as it gets in SoCal.,Surly locals.,Most difficult access in Southern California if you don't have land-access.

The rock jetty wards off a S wind fairly well, and the wave can have good form when the rest of Mission is blown out.

Because of all the variables of tide, swell, wind and bottom contour, Cronkite changes from day to day and even the most experienced local can rarely predict what the surf will be like until they get there. All of the surfing takes place in the north half of the beach, which picks up just about anything pulsing in from the S, N or W. In summer, Cronkite is a S swell magnet. The very north end of the beach magnifies whatever energy is out there, and it can be one of the few surfable places on the coast during the doldrums.During fall and winter, Cronkite shape-shifts from day to day. The beach likes a small N or W swell up to about head-high and maybe a little beyond. Anything over that and the beach overloads. On a good day, just overhead and out of the W with offshore winds and the right tide, Cronkite can be a pretty damn good wave -- barreling and challenging. But most days are something less than this, and the majority of waves at Cronkite are somewhere between junk and hollow closeouts. During huge swells, you get an eyeful of the Potato Patch clashing just offshore, with huge rouge peaks running perpendicular to the beach. Fortunately, the Potato Patch knocks down a lot of swell that would otherwise bombard Cronkite, which means Cronkite can have surfable waves even during the biggest swells.

The place has been called a ""sparkling jewel among Oregon's coastal resort communities,"" and, seeing the town is a straight 80-mile zip from Portland and only 28 miles south of Washington, the place gets overrun with tourists throughout spring, summer and autumn.Most of the immediate shoreline is thick with hotels, inns and private residences, barring views and public beach access. Offshore rocks and seastacks abound, including the famous Haystack Rock (the third tallest monolith in the world at 235 feet), fronted mostly by hard-sand beaches and steep, dripping cliffs. It's an area of tasteful business buildings and quiet residential retreats along unmarked dirt roads. The homes blend in seamlessly with the landscape, all brown, wooden and unpretentious. As for the surf, the nine or so miles from Ecola Creek south to Falcon Cove (including Tolovana Beach and Cannon Beach proper) is basically all beachbreak, thus surfable only when small and clean. The mouth of Ecola Creek occasionally has a good bar.Just south of Cape Falcon, most North Coast denizens choose Oswald West State Park, aka Short Sands Beach, as their premier spot due to its wind protection and sand bottom. (Mr. Oswald West was Oregon's governor from 1911-1915.) Although it's a few miles south of town, you'll always find a posse of Cannonites and Seasiders out here. It's a beautiful spot, entailing a 20-minute stroll through old-growth forest to access the white-sand, driftwood-strewn beach. The surf can either be peaky and hollow or soft and mushy, depending on the tide and swell factor. It's a horseshoe cove, so the place is safe from all but west winds. Nonetheless, Short Sands is hardly a substantial spot -- more like a retreat from the wind than a good place to log tube time. Cannon Beach received its name from the 500-ton U.S. Naval survey schooner Shark, which was wrecked while attempting to leave the Columbia River on September 10, 1846. In an effort to slide the ship off of the rivermouth's immense sandspit, the three masts were hacked off and the cannon were jettisoned, but the boat began to break up and the crew took to its boats.

Siding the Rogue River, the south jetty at Gold Beach (""a little town...a lotta fun"") is one of them: another stubby little jetty facing southwest, producing some powerful peaks with hefty currents and a massive seal population. Named for the gold that was found near here in the mid-1800s, the beach is layered with driftwood, backed by low dunes overrun with the invasive European grass. Hollow right wedges prevail given the correct wind and tide, although the bars are inept to withstand anything bigger than a foot or two overhead. The beach drop-off is relatively abrupt, causing for some heavy shorepound and frequent difficulty for paddling out.Maddeningly fickle, the jetty shines through during windless conditions with a small swell and incoming tide. Forget about it during the wintertime, when south winds dominate and northerly swell overloads the place. Springtime can be good since north-northwest winds blow sideshore/offshore here, but don't count on the surf to settle down until April at the earliest.

However, if you accidentally go straight on Oak Street, you'll reconnect with A1A about a mile south. Just be careful and adhere strictly to speed limits on Oak Street -- this is a family neighborhood area with lots of kids along with a couple preschools and the local elmentary school, so Melbourne Beach Police are usually posted up to keep drivers honest.After turning left at the traffic light, you're on Ocean Avenue. Drive two blocks till you see a flagpole flying the American and Florida flags in the center of a small short-term parking lot overlooking the beach. Adjacent to that parking lot are sand volleyball courts, a pavilion and a second parking facility. Sand shifts over the course of a year, changing the break from a mushy outside wave to a strong shorepound. The break is most appreciated for being relatively deep, limiting the shutdown factor that plagues most Central Florida spots on large swells. When it's small, the semi-mushy conditions and open lineup make Ocean Avenue a mix of old-school longboarders and Mel Beach groms. Most travelers either zip by or drive through the beachside lot for a quick peek on their way to Sebastian.",Intermediate - advanced,Can be okay for newer surfers when small.

This inlet became the focal point in supporting a growing fishing industry and becoming a popular recreation area. The ebb and flow of sand up and the the coast occasionally closed off the inlet until 1948 when the current inlet was blasted open, creating the permanent opening we see today. While people do occasionally surf the south side of the Inlet, the north side is home to the jetty and all its glories, including the big-league spot, First Peak, and its slightly less-perfect but equally popular siblings Second Peak, Third Peak and OK Signs/Swimmers. Swells bounce off the jetty at First Peak with extra juice that can either max out the potential of a one-foot dribbler or add a few feet -- and one heck of a barrel -- to a head-high nugget. Second Peak, Third Peak and OK Signs don't benefit from the jetty's wedge, but are almost as fun.

When a good swell is running, many sections of these sandbars create good, long walls. Watch out for rocks, though. When conditions are right, a fun wave will break beyond the dunes at any given point, but the Jupiter Inlet's south side is one of the best big waves around. It's also one of the few good rights in South Florida.While a decent left breaks off the main outside peak, the right is what makes the Inlet famous. Before the south jetty was extended in 1998-99, there was also a rippable left inside the cove and adjacent to the jetty. That wave is essentially gone now, but the outside right is still strong. At smaller sizes, it may seem like a weak A-frame, but when a big E-NE swell is running, the right comes to life and wraps in toward the jetty, bending like a pointbreak with hollow sections. The main peak is way outside between the jetty and the lifeguard tower. It's best to paddle out along the jetty, but mind the currents. A strong outgoing tide might be a one-way ticket to the Bahamas, and staying on the peak is like paddling upriver.

It's not particularly hollow, but it's exceptionally racy and barrels toward the inside on larger swells. SW winds open the lefts even more.The coastline south of Palm Beach Inlet faces slightly southeast, so while N winds blow sideshore across the Inlet, they do little to bother the lefts at Reef Road.

Although the outside reef fires on occasion, it's really an inside wave and something of a reform. It can't hold much size, but north swells in the shoulder-high range will spiral into good, left barrels. Rare souths spin excellent rights, and windswells construct good ramps for a growing number of aerialists.Flagpole is part of the Palm Beach Public Beach, which sits at the end of Royal Palm Way, a continuation of Okeechobee Boulevard. Either come up A1A from Southern Boulevard (or from farther south), or come east across the middle bridge (Okeechobee Bridge) until you run into the beach. Metered parking is plentiful but costly. The Palm Beach Police Force and its underlying meter maids are sticklers. Many of them harbor a grudge against surfers, so be sure to drive the speed limit. There are free one-hour parking places along the east/west streets.The sand shifts quite a bit, and different swells will focus better on different peaks, but the main break is between the flagpole, the lifeguard tower and Charlie's Crab Restaurant. Be nice to the lifeguards. Most of them are surfers, so if they clear a good peak, they're just doing their jobs. The public beach is usually crowded, especially on weekends, holidays and before and after business and school hours. Local grommets and transplants from Palm Beach Atlantic College overrun the wave, and though it's generally a user-friendly place with enough peaks to go around, it gets very competitive when school is out. Furthermore, there are a few aggressive, older locals who have weathered all the changes and who understandably feel they are entitled to their pick of the litter.

From the beautiful stone Cliff Walk between the architectural wonders and the ocean, you get a view of it all.The beach at Ruggles, or more correctly, the cliff, faces east into the Rhode Island Sound. On solid south-to-southeast swells, particularly hurricane swells, ledging right-handers march around the corner and right into the natural arena. The wave itself isn't hollow but instead allows plenty of room for carving. A semi-gun, and sometimes even a full-fledged gun, is needed on serious swells, which is to say the only swells when Ruggles is really working anyway.

375,Monahan's Dock,Rhode Island - West,Rhode Island,New England,41.4216,-71.4539,America/New_York,"Also known as State Pier #5 and Tucker’s Dock, Monahan’s Dock is one of Rhode Island’s heaviest waves. The rocky pier at the end of the seawall sets the stage for a short, punchy A-frame with a heavier, hollower right and a softer, more rippable left. The ideal swell can produce dredging, thick, tall barrels bending into a bowly end section. There’s rarely any current here, but the place breaks a lot of boards — and bones. By East Coast standards, Monahan's is a high-risk surf spot. The ride is short, but the waves have power and break directly into the jetty. Before surf leashes, few people risked surfing here because of the potential damage to their surfboards. With today's lightly glassed shortboards, a broken leash at Monahan's most often means terminal board damage. In sticking to the high-risk theme, Monahan's is not only a heavy wave, but a holder of heavy crowds. Personal injury and/or damaged surfboards are more likely here than at any other New England break: there is one peak and one takeoff spot, so tensions dramatically increase when four or more surfers are out. Any session with more than 10 people out should be considered a waste of time, but that doesn't seem to stop twice as many people from paddling out at the same time. At such times, Monahan's becomes a circus: a great wave too often overrun by clowns. The vibe in the water is as heavy as you'll find anywhere.

It's not until you drive into the parking lot overlooking the break that you will see that Point Judith is actually a series of separate, distinct breaks -- sometimes connecting for a section or two, but most often not. Quickly, you realize this is not the J-Bay of the East. Access to the break involves climbing down to a rocky beach and negotiating a boulder-strewn lineup to reach the surf. The rocks are covered with black moss and are extremely slippery, especially when wet. Barnacles cover many of the rocks in the surf zone, and no channel exists for paddling. This won't be a problem in small-to-medium swells, but when the larger swells roll into town and across the reef at Judith, they come with strong currents and board-breaking power.The south side of the point has what has been referred to as a ""death zone"", located near a large breakwater where unfortunate (read unknowledgeable) surfers sometimes find themselves in a no-win situation of being pinned in a rocky corner by the current and surf. A good local hint is that the point, while well-exposed to the wind, can still be really fun and uncrowded on large, windblown, winter days.

By the early 1970s, images began floating back to surf magazines in the U.S. that depicted green, flawlessly peeling right peaks stacked to the horizon -- the Sunset Beach comparisons flowed liberally. For the era, Sunzal was probably El Salvador's best wave, but today it's a different story, because modern surfboard design far better compliments the many other right pointbreaks -- like Punta Roca and Las Flores -- on Salvador's tidy yet wave-rich coast.Today, Sunzal is the spot of choice for the weekend warrior from San Salvador. El Tunco, the little village just on the south side of the river mouth has transformed from a rough backwater to a trendy vacation spot for locals and travelers alike, laid back during the week and absolutely pulsing on the weekends. Couple the tourist-friendly atmosphere of Tunco with the user-friendly peaks of Sunzal and you've got a recipe for one helluva stew in the line-up, from young local rippers to giggly Danish backpacker girls out for their first session... and everything in-between.The wave itself is a peculiar experience. From a distance it is easy to see how the Sunset comparisons came about, but in the water you'll quickly realize the two are distant cousins. Because its broad cobble reef juts so much farther out into the ocean than the rest of the nearby coast, Sunzal will suck in every bit of swell out there. The point is sharply angled and relatively deep, which means the wave will retain its shape in all but the largest of swells, but will also be soft and riddled with fat sections. As a result, Sunzal has become Salvador's hotspot for both longboarders and, when it's small, beginners. Nevertheless, if everywhere else is flat, Sunzal will almost always have something to offer.

Your bottom turns are extended 30 yards, and top turns can last longer than some commercials. The top of the point is west of the rivermouth and acts as the main takeoff zone; as such, it's competitive. If you're lucky enough to get a wave from here, you get three or four semi-bowly sections where you can do a few carves. As you approach the rivermouth the wave speeds up and (depending on the tide) can get super-hollow, so you need to start tucking and pumping and going as fast as your surfboard will carry you. After you pass the rivermouth, the wave slows down again for a bit before tapering perfectly into the bay, as your legs give out (you've surfed almost a mile already). Then you step out onto the sand and slog back up the point for more. But it's fickle as all hell.

448,Santa Catalina - La Punta,Southwest Panama,Panama,Central America South,7.6235,-81.2577,America/Panama,"Santa Catalina is a broad, flat, rocky shelf that gradually slopes into a south/southwest-facing bay, with lava-rock fingers that jut out at the top of the reef and force any swell bigger than two feet to rear up and rifle down the line. At high tide, the first section on the right is a high-'n'-tight barrel followed by a speed run into another barrel section a-ways down the line, followed by a series of bowls all the way through the inside. At low tide, the right barrels and hisses and spits super close to the jagged volcanic reef, making it safe only for the crazy or Tom Curren, who visits regularly and has been known to get very long, very deep tubes here.The left is shorter -- and you sure as hell don't surf it when it's double overhead or bigger, at risk of getting creamed on the way back out -- but it can be a good option for goofyfoots or anyone else sick of battling the ever-present crowd. It also has a little barrel section off the drop, but its wall is way shorter than the right's. The bonus is you could get three lefts to every right. So if you're a real frother and can't sit still for the occasional lull with a crowd on the rights, then perhaps the lefts are for you.Catalina, while it often can get quite big, isn't really a difficult wave to surf, at least at high tide. Swells come in and feel the reef and draw up into a fairly obvious A-frame, with a long right wall and a shorter left bowl -- take off, stall, and pull in.

It's definitely a performance wave, and after a few weeks of surfing here your level will unquestionably go up a notch.Low tide is a different story and most folks don't even bother, even though it looks appealing -- it's too shallow and unpredictable. If you must surf at low tide, make sure to kick out before the inside double-up bowl section -- that lava is pretty damn sharp. Ideally, you could bring three boards: your regular, everyday shortboard for everything up to a few feet overhead, a rounded pintail mini-gun or hybrid step-up for surfing both Catalina and the outer islands up to double overhead.

It's flanked at its top end by Big Groyne that finishes Coolangatta Beach, and at its bottom end 400 yards down the line by Little Groyne, protecting Kirra Beach to the north. Between the groynes is the original point, a scattered lava outcropping extended from a headland to its south. Also between the groynes is stretched the long ribbon of sand responsible for Kirra's super-tube magic.Because it's tucked inside the line of Point Danger, the place gets less swell than any of the other Gold Coast points. Kirra wakes up in solid E and NE swells from cyclones and long-angled South Pacific fetches. These swells hit the sandbar at a nice 45-degree angle and suck their ways with increasing intensity toward Little Groyne and sometimes even past it. When the sand is right it's literally sectionless, the barrel forming and reforming like some sort of incredible moving version of a wave machine, yet with all the weight of the ocean pushing behind it. Large volumes of water run down the outside rim of the sandbar, which makes paddling back out a grueling proposition; many experienced Kirra surfers just get out of the water at a ride's finish and jog back up along the rim of the point to the jump-off point.The sand is not consistent; it shifts between groynes, and in the past it's even created a heavy big left across from the natural point, which shows in very N-angled cyclone swells.

Off the bigger point, the wave tends to be superficially attractive, but inclined to mush out a bit unless it's big or the sand is right on target. Both these sections are sheltered from the classic fall/winter southerly wind, and nicely offshore in a southwesterly to westerly. On the other side of the headland is a classic 'back beach' -- a less-frequented beach behind a well-known pointbreak - a clean, curving beach that runs for a couple miles down to the next headland, Hastings Point.

Naturally enough, there's a considerable quantity of surf spots in the area.On the tip of the Cape there's Watego's and Little Watego's. Kind of a combination reef/sand pointbreak, it produces slow rights.From there the whole thing opens up into The Pass, Byron's serious point. A long, winding right, it's dependent on sand distribution but usually starts close to a rock outcrop and peels down toward Clark's Beach over a half mile away. Often the wave gets hollower as it runs down the line. Competition for set waves on good days isn't so much intense as almost impossible.Opposite the town center there lies the remains of a wrecked ship, which can create decent sandbars. Creatively known as Shipwrecks or the Wreck, this is a wedged-up wave, occasionally very hollow and a lot of fun. There are also a few little beachbreaks between the Wreck and the Pass.All these spots require an east to northeast swell to really fire. None of them pick up much from the predominant southeast swell angle unless it's really big. To cash in on smaller souths, you've gotta head south of the Cape to Tallow Beach, a lovely long clean sand stretch of occasionally superb quality beachbreaks.

At times these points will lie virtually dormant for months, while most surfers head south toward Sunshine Beach and Coolum for consistent beachbreaks. Yet when the right swell does arrive, it's pretty sick. Granite is usually the least crowded and least spectacular of the five. Ti-Tree drives long rights off a bouldery headland into a changeable sandbar/rock setup with some good barrels on lower tides. National Park has a dramatic and difficult takeoff zone known as Boiling Pot, followed by 250-500 yards of reeling, sectiony wall, sometimes running right through Johnsons Corner to Little Cove and on to First Point.

549,Waimea Bay,Oahu North Shore,Oahu,Hawaii,21.6424,-158.065,Pacific/Honolulu,"Waimea's outer waters are very deep and clear of any outer reefs or shoals. As a result, much of the energy of long period swells is refracted away from the Bay by the flanking outer reefs at Alligators and Log Cabins, leaving Waimea in a bit of a swell void. This can make the place appear deceptively calm during the early stages of a big swell, compared to some of the other nearby spots. As the interval falls within the mid-period bands, watch for more swell energy to pour into the Bay. On big and longer period swells, Waimea will actually peak later than some of the other nearby spots of which favor the initial longer period energy. When Waimea starts to work, look for the bay to turn into a massive washing machine, where water floods in along each side of the Bay and a big rip current pulls out to sea in the center. Meanwhile, it's the big waves breaking way out off the top of the point on the northside of the bay that is the world renown spot. In contrast to all this mad aquatic activity going on further inside the bay, the actual takeoff zone can be quite mellow between sets.Rideable waves first begin to break when the surf climbs into the overhead to double overhead-plus zone on a section known as Pinballs -- a lumpy reef almost parallel with the tip of the Bay's north point that can be fun on clean NW swells with a light tradewind blowing. As the swell grows beyond 3-4 times overhead, waves begin to peak and break just inside a big boil 80 yards out past Pinballs, providing a drop, a fat shoulder and some reform shots further in. As the surf increases further, waves will starting breaking on the shallower regions of the true Waimea takeoff area -- a relatively flat lava rock ledge another 50 yards or so outside the boil that lurches abruptly from much deeper water. It's the sudden appearance of this ledge, magnifying the challenge of a late drop, that gives Waimea its characteristic semi-freefall takeoff. The ledge slopes off rapidly to the west but maintains a slight ridge out toward the north, sometimes (particularly on a more northerly angled swell) forming a takeoff spot further out known as Eddie's Peak. After a complex and exhilarating drop, the rider is faced with a flat shoulder and a mountain of whitewater, which can sometimes be pursued into the Pinballs section. Toward the beach, waves will back off and reform into an extremely powerful shorebreak, growing thicker and bigger toward the western end and sometimes showcasing a hideously tempting left barrel.Getting in and out is done through the keyhole, located close to the rocks in the northeast corner of the bay, where the shorebreak is smallest. On smaller days it's a cruise, but will start to require a little timing as it gets bigger. Trying to come in through the shorebreak toward the southern end of the bay is not recommended; several surfers have made the Bay Loop famous (the process of heading right back out to sea and around again in order to nail the keyhole exit).",Advanced,"Expert big-wave surfers only, even they need to exercise extreme caution.",Doable,Humility and respect a must.,Heavy,Heavy,Fun,Waimea has always been and always will be a big-wave surfers proving ground.,Medium,"Besides the long paddle out there, the paddling is not too bad once you're in the line-up.

Giant Nusa is a difficult playing field, and surfers should use extreme caution when looking out at what appears to be fun, six to eight-foot waves with nobody out.

With all of these breaks to choose from, Uluwatu is an ultra-consistent spot. Depending on the tide and swell size, any of these breaks will usually be firing at one point during the day. Generally, due to the access through the cave and the strong currents, the best possible conditions for larger swells are very low tides. Smaller and medium swells work well on all tides. During smaller swells, look for barrels and peaky surf on the higher tides at The Peak. On lower tides, The Racetrack can provide an ultra-fast reef grinder with a big barrel at the end. Those who choose to cut back often miss the end section, hence the name, The Racetrack. When surfing The Racetrack it is important to known the tides. On a middle tide, most advanced surfers will be able to negotiate the end section barrel with success. Once the tide drops, and especially on the lower tides of the month, The Racetrack end section is a twisting, multi-section barrel, a very dangerous place for experts and professionals only. When the largest swells of the year hit Bali, Uluwatu transforms into a true big-wave surfing venue - The Peak, Racetrack and Temples are all under whitewater, and Uluwatu's outer reefs, The Bombie and Outside Corner, come alive.

616,Pipeline & Backdoor,Oahu North Shore,Oahu,Hawaii,21.6682,-158.051,Pacific/Honolulu,"The most famous surf spot in the world, Pipe is capable of pulling the most incredible disappearing acts. During times of minor or no swell (such as summer), the casual observer rolling up to Ehukai Beach Park and gazing west wouldn't have any idea it was there.Pipeline benefits from an outer reef refraction effect, which with the ideal swell direction (WNW-NW) and size will focus an abundance of waves into this zone. When such a swell hits the North Shore, suddenly the wave that wasn't there before comes roaring back with all the energy and beauty that has drawn surfers for generations. Depending on the direction, size, and period, this wave will become peakier with a dual option. In addition to the Pipeline Left, a super-hollow right known as Backdoor will open up and funnel across the shallow reef toward its close neighbor of Off-The-Wall.Classic Pipe (the left) relies on two outer reefs -- Outer Log Cabins and Third Reef -- to refract an approaching WNW-NW swell into a long wall finishing with a tapered peak that hits the inside reef, known as First Reef, about 60 to 80 yards offshore. First Reef is mostly flat solid lava with a few small caves under the takeoff zone, which will create distinct boils on the wave face. Even when it's small, a WNW-NW swell at First Reef is always tremendously powerful, breaking hard on the reef and holding a lot of energy in the lip. When in the two-to-three feet overhead zone, it's an exciting left barrel that almost looks user friendly. Around the double overhead mark, it's arguably at its most dangerous, sucking brutally hard off the shallowest patch of reef. From double to triple overhead, it opens up a little more, with some waves breaking on another slab of the inside reef about 10-15 yards outside the main zone, allowing a little easier entry (relatively speaking). At around 4 times overhead-plus, waves begin breaking in big, foamy lumps on Second Reef, another 80 yards or so outside. Then, Pipe itself becomes a second reform section - sometimes a steep walled, close-out; other times a mad belching pit; and other times it is simply washed out by an avalanche of white-wash rolling through from Second Reef.The wave is prone to sand build up along the inside reef, especially along the fringe near the Ehukai Channel, which occurs during north to northeast swells and the current sweeping from Rocky Point toward Pipe -- this scenario is common through the Summer months and shoulder seasons. When sand is packed tight along this reef line, Pipe becomes a hideous closeout, particularly with swells slightly north of west.

619,Teahupoo,Tahiti and Moorea,Tahiti,French Polynesia,-17.8672,-149.254,Pacific/Tahiti,"There can be only one ""world's heaviest wave"", and that title rests soundly with the wave at Teahupo'o (don't make saying it more difficult than it need be; it's pronounced Cho-poo). Along the southern end of the smaller of Tahiti's two extinct volcanoes, Tahiti Iti, the tiny town of Teahupo'o is where the pavement stops. Surfers have sampled the South Pacific island since the early 1960s, but prior to the mid-'80s, surfers had no reason to venture that far, especially considering the wealth of hollow reef breaks encircling the rest of the island. Consider that all Bruce Brown and crew got out of Tahiti was ""Ins and Outs"", a piddly mushburger that bounces off a bulkhead and can be ridden seaward. But one day, a few locals ventured out on a small swell and found that the wave at the end of the road was within the realm of possibility.Physically, nothing has changed since then, but with the increased attention the wave has stirred, Teahupo'o has become a well-trod yet still undercover surf destination. No hotels stand within an hour's drive, and the nearest surf shop is almost as far. If you're looking for a McDonald's you'd better not leave Papeete. But the main ingredients are in abundance -- warm water, friendly locals, and an endlessly challenging wave.Teahupo'o is no different from any of the other reef passes around Tahiti -- that is, if they were all pumped on steroids, coffee, and Megadeth. The reef here is very much alive, as you will find out soon after brushing against it for the first time. Infections of the bloodstream are as common as mosquito bites, so a good cleansing is imperative after any break in the skin. Treated properly, you won't have to sit in the boat for long.There's very little swell attenuation thanks to a complete lack of continental shelf outside the breaks, which explains why Teahupo'o is often way bigger than anywhere else -- it faces directly into the prevailing southwest swell. But there are a number of high quality breaks and passes along the west and southwest shores of the island. On the drive from Papeete to Teahupo'o, you'll pass Ta'apuna (a lovely clean left with a swinging end bowl, good to six feet), Sapenuse (a reef-based point break, popular among longboarders, with an outside section capable of handling horrendous Teahupo'o-style action), Papara'a (the sole beachbreak on the island and center of Tahiti's social beach life), and the lesser-known Mara'a and Vairao passes, along with several other semi-passes and reef bumps where fun waves can be ridden without absolute danger to life or limb.Teahupo'o breaks the mold, not only for Tahiti, but for the world as we known it. Millions of years ago, freshwater flowing from nearby mountains killed a large section of the surrounding reef, creating what is known as Passa Hava'e. The surf along the western side forms an unrideable closeout, but then again, that's what they said about Teahupo'o not so long ago. Teahupo'o's reef is shaped like your left arm if you're looking at your watch. The inside of your arm forms the lagoon while swells approach your upper arm from the left side. Depending on the angle, the wave either forms a flawless barrel or an inescapable nightmare. The more south the swell is, the better your chances of survival.The lineup is relatively small, maybe seventy-five yards in all, and there are really only two legitimate takeoff spots. Anything else is an invitation for disaster. The first, requiring loads of confidence and speed to burn, is located behind the main barrel section. It provides an easier entry, but your options from this spot are reduced: pull in or get snuffed. If you are well versed in riding left hand barrels, it's a dream wave. If there's any hitch in your getup, say goodnight.From the other takeoff spot, closer toward the shoulder but still within the peak of the end section, the drop is more critical, but you are afforded a measure of leeway. If for some reason you pass on the barrel, a few carves and a kick out provide a reasonable alternative. However, this is the shallowest section of a freakishly hollow wave, so plan on getting barreled or stick to another pass around the island. A mistake here and you will become intimate with the shallowest section of the reef.Occasionally, surfers take off either ridiculously deep or cautiously far on the shoulder. Neither is advised. From way back, the wave often bottoms out upon takeoff, ensuring a freefall into oblivion. If the drop is properly negotiated, a frothy barrel is possible, but the paddle back out could unceremoniously end your session. On the other hand, a shoulder takeoff is sort of like trying to hit a baseball once it is already in the catcher's mitt. You've missed the perfect pitch, and even if you make contact, it's nothing but a dribbler. Either go deep or not at all.Regardless of takeoff positioning, the ride at Teahupo'o is a short one. A barrel and one turn is pretty much maximum capacity. Any more and a reef dance becomes a near-certainty. But with such intensity, you won't hear anyone complain about the length of ride. It would take a full ride at Jeffreys Bay to equal the rush.An interesting trait of Teahupo'o -- and one that increases its brute force -- is that regardless of size the wave pretty much breaks in the same place. There is no third reef to diffuse the intensity of massive swells; rather, everything piles up on the inside reef, creating a top-heavy, below sea-level mutant that you wouldn't conjure even while doodling in high school.",Advanced,Advanced,Welcoming,Mellow if you're respectful.

Open-ocean power unloads on a football-sized playing field at Sunset Beach, forcing surfers to ride different equipment and approach the wave differently than they would their everyday beachbreak or even at a world-class reef. The most successful surfers at Sunset push past any fear and are willing to adjust their approach to suit the reef’s wide variability and moody nature. The Sunset arena is made up of many different spots or sections of the reef, starting with a spot not far off the beach called Val’s Reef. It’s a shifty, bowly peak that can offer up fun little waves when there’s not much swell running. The Inside Bowl is an end section directly outside Val’s Reef about 200 meters offshore and is a bit separate from the main break. It links up with the main sections on a more NNW/N swell and is an unpredictable and often violent portion of Sunset that is responsible for many casualties to board and rider. Outside of Val’s and the Inside Bowl is the West Peak, where WNW/NW swell energy (especially more westerly angled swell) rises quickly from the deep channel, refracting back in toward the portion of the wrapping swell line. Next across the reef is The Point. Wave shape and the takeoff point at the Point depends heavily on the swell direction. North to NE swells will fold crosswise over the reef fingers that extend out from the shore, breaking up the swell lines to create different takeoff spots with unpredictable, sectiony waves. More westerly swells focus better over at the West Peak/Bowl, amplifying the wave into a very powerful, bowling wedge peak. For the Point to behave like a right pointbreak, northwest/north-northwest angled swells allow the wave to bend in and run along the reef. Past the Point is an area known as Backyards, where waves break across a broad lava platform that slowly drops away offshore. Double overhead+ sets can break far off the beach, however, the best shape tends to be around head-high to a few feet overhead, where it can produce peaks with excellent rights and lefts. Sunset is also known for lots of paddling, especially the bigger it gets, as there is lots of water moving around out there. Rides can be long, so the distance to get back out is long. However, if you make good use of the Kammieland Rip running out in the channel of the bay, then getting back out to the lineup is not so bad.

On these bigger days, you can be paddling with all your might on the inside but still going backwards toward the impact zone -- so falling on the first wave of a set can be devastating. Best bet is to finish rides all the way to the end, kick out as far as you can into the channel and ride the current back out, while still padding away from the impact zone. When the surf is small, especially on the more NW to NNW angled swells, it seems so harmless, like a fun little beach break somewhere. Smart surfers at Haleiwa learn to use the rip, not sweating the paddle out, waiting a few yards wide of the takeoff, then letting themselves be drawn into the pit for the waves they want. Not-so-smart surfers go straight to the takeoff spot, then spend the next 15 minutes paddling against the rip just to stay in position.As the swell backs away from its logical maximum -- around the triple overhead mark -- the wave loosens up and begins breaking on the shallower areas of reef, providing some deep tubes. Overhead to double overhead-plus from the WNW-NW is the wave's best size and direction -- too much north will be shadowed by Pua'ena Point, and too west will be shadowed by Avalanche and Kauai. When the surf is under head high, Haleiwa looks like a playful, semi-closed-out beachbreak; also, a left will begin to show its face from the middle of the reef, peeling back toward the harbor wall. On the inside a few yards out from the sand, a foot-high reform will give beginners something to play with as well.",All Abilities,"All levels, but depends on size.",Doable,Humility and respect a must.,Heavy,Moderate to heavily crowded,Fun,One of the most high performance waves on the North Shore.,Exhausting,"Easy on  small days but the bigger it gets, the worse the paddle, especially on the more westerly angled swells.",Fair,The close proximity to Haleiwa Harbor makes pollution a common hazard.,"Shallow reef sections and the current (especially on a big west swell, when sets swing wide over shallow reef).",Easy: Big public parking lot at Ali'i Beach Park right in front of Haleiwa.,"Shortboard, bodyboard",Reef,Winter

The wave is a long left, with a few different tube sections and a range of takeoff spots, but it's at its most focused and perfect when a solid S swell detonates on the outside bowl section. The seabed next to the reef was dredged for Ala Wai Harbor, thus the man-made interference bends swell and refracts it. And even though really big sets are still referred to as Pole Sets, the pole that once indicated such incoming bombs is now gone.The Ala Moana Bowls left can hold solid size and breaks off toward the harbor channel, but Bowls also offers a shorter right on smaller days that will usually end as a closeout section on the very shallow inside reef.

This line of defense isn't held against any third-world nation, but a first. The 17 miles of softly trodden coast between Trestles -- which is technically just inside the San Diego county line -- and Oceanside is said to be the only break in the string of stucco strip malls and planned communities that would someday have stretched from Oxnard to Tijuana. Whether an actual, or just emotional, defense, these miles of coast are imagined to have held the garishness of Orange and L.A. counties at bay.Oceanside, the northernmost coastal city in San Diego County, has carried the weight of Camp Pendleton for almost a century. Its main drag caters to hot-rodding Marines and inland tourists. There are car dealerships, motorcycle dealerships, watercraft dealerships, head shops, $5 barbershop specials, a bowling alley and a Dairy Queen. Add to this a mixed civilian population and you get a beach town as interesting as its surf is consistent. Many of its attributes would be foreboding of the region's character if it weren't for Oceanside's enduring, podunk charm. And, despite its burdens and reputation as a rough town, Oceanside is easily one of the most livable surf communities in the county.Although sandbars move and shift along this stretch continually, there are consistent breaks on the north end at the harbor's north and south jetties, and on both sides of the pier. These spots will most often have a crew of surfers on them, but, on better days, the peaks up and down the beach will be just as good. Oceanside is angled to receive southwest swells more readily than the beaches of central San Diego County, and, during southwest swells, it attracts surfers from all parts of SD.

Surfers with little travel experience should note that outer-reef waves like Cloudbreak travel much faster than their continental-land-mass counterparts, and if you don't concentrate on getting to your feet quickly, chances are that you will find yourself picking coral from your back.Despite what you may have heard, Cloudbreak can be relatively sectiony, and the lineup involves a large playing field. The swell sweeping toward the reef generally focuses on one of three general areas: the Point (aka The Top), the Middle, and the Inside (aka Shish Kabobs). Because the introductory perspective to Cloudbreak is from a boat in the channel, guests often assume that the inside is the best and safest place to park oneself because of its proximity to deeper water. The truth is that although the inside section can offer some nice tubes and can be a faster escape route to the channel, it's actually the Point and the Middle that have the more forgiving, rippable waves. The inside section is known as Shish Kabobs for a reason: a standard visitor's tax is paid in flesh to the sharp, skewer-like reef that lies just below the surface.Even for the experienced surfer, sizable Cloudbreak can represent a significantly intimidating experience. Thick, fast-moving lefts can hit different parts of the reef at a number of different angles, and it can often be a difficult task figuring out where to be to catch the best waves. Once you get it wired, a good session at Cloudbreak is nothing short of a complete barrel-fest. On fairly rare occasions, large, clean long-interval swells turn Cloudbreak into an astonishing one-section wave that breaks on a part of the reef known affectionately as the Ledge (actually the outside of the inside). If you're lucky enough to surf or simply watch this magnificent leviathan, you've witnessed one of the great wonders of the world.",Advanced,Advanced ,Welcoming,"Unlike the rest of the world, Tavarua has a highly encouraged system of wave sharing.

Because this place is somewhat protected from swell and wind, it is mostly a beginner to intermediate wave.Linda Mar has its epic days, but for the most part, the surf ranges from poor to so-so, and the water is crowded with beginners and intermediate surfers. ""It's the poor person's Cowell's,"" as one local surfer described it.Linda Mar has a reputation for being gray and gloomy, but even in the thick of the region's summer fog season, there's often an inexplicable donut of sunshine beating down on the place. Linda Mar is at the end of a big valley that funnels south and southwest winds into offshores, and the surf can be cranking there during the winter, when the rest of the coast is blown out. The same condition can exist in the summer, when that valley will turn the onshore fog winds into offshores. Linda Mar can be sunny and nice when Ocean Beach is like Moscow in winter.From north to south, the first spot at Linda Mar is called Round House.

835,Lake Worth Pier,Palm Beach County - South,Florida - East Coast,Florida,26.6129,-80.0353,America/New_York,"Between the main cities of West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale are three smaller coastal communities, and each claim a surfing centerpiece that can be accessed off A1A. Lake Worth, which divides Palm Beach and South Palm Beach, has a pier of questionable reputation. Lantana is a couple miles south of Lake Worth on the west side of the Intracoastal Waterway, but also boasts a popular public beach. Boynton Beach, which has its own inlet and park, sits farther south between Manalapan and Delray Beach.  Watch out for underwater rocks along the shore.When the sandbars are established, this pier provides the most consistent surf in South Florida. It's inside Lake Worth Municipal Beach off A1A, with plenty of metered parking for $1/hour.  Don't mess around; these babies are really enforced.Lake Worth was once one of the most viciously localized break in Florida, which is probably why it's barely known beyond state lines. During the '70s and '80s, visiting surfers would encounter nightmarish ultra-violence of the ""harass your girlfriend,""  ""break your board"" and ""smash your windshield"" variety. Once, after being dropped in on, a local followed his provocateur to the beach and proceeded to smash the surfer's board on a parking meter. The upset visitor took a swing at the local, but quickly found himself hog-tied around the very parking meter that took out his surfboard and was later found and untied by the police.  Things have mellowed quite a bit since then.Clearly, Lake Worth must house a good wave to justify such extreme measures; in fact, it offers several. First, just before the guarded area on the south side of the pier, a sandbar runs farther south in front of an old seawall called Blackwall. When north or northeast swells are running and the sand is settled, fast, hollow waves reel along this bar, earning it the hyperbolic name, Banzai.The Pier's south side maintains an outside sandbar as well. Overhead swells will break off the end of the pier, mush out and then reform down by Blackwall. On the biggest swells, it gets steep and fast and occasionally connects all the way through to the inside. The south side is one of the better spots during nor'easter conditions -- if there isn't too much underlying groundswell -- as the waves are shielded somewhat from the wind.While north swells can sometimes bypass Palm Beach and be bigger in Lake Worth, the pier gets juiciest during east/southeast windswells. Sandbars off Blackwall will throw good rights under these conditions. However, if Northside is working, it's arguably the best peak on either side of the pilings, throwing hollow, high-speed, top-to-bottom rights. Some of the waves break left through the pier, and if you like to tempt fate and arouse the ire of authorities, shooting the pier is a good way to do both. This once highly highly localized spot is a bit tamer. Go to spot on windswells and can be some fun chunky wedges even if the wind is onshore. NE swells can get big here with basically no continental shelf thanks to its position close to the Florida Current. This spot can handle any size thrown at it and have seen faces 20'+ on the biggest swells. When it gets big, grab a bigger board and be ready to paddle.",All Abilities,All levels but give the better surfers some space.,Intimidating,Used to be heavy but mellow now.,Moderate,Can get very busy.,Fun,Go to spot on windswells and can be some fun chunky wedges even if the wind is onshore.

Surfers from all over New England rely on Second Beach to provide relief from the summer doldrums. It often has good shape and the cliffs on the west side of the beach provide some protection from prevailing southwest winds. First Beach, just to the south, is another fun beachbreak -- while smaller than Second Beach on a south swell, it has more luck with surf from the east. Occasionally, the bay fills with tremendous amounts of red seaweed that can make surfing unpleasant at both beaches.Newport has other, lesser-known breaks that come alive on good swells. They're hard to find, and you won't find a red carpet waiting for you if you do find them.

The initial takeoff zone to the end of the wave usually averages over 300 yards when it's on. It is mostly a sand-bottom break, however, there are rock/reef sections at certain points along this long wave. These intermittent areas of sand and reef allow for a variety of barrel and wally sections throughout the length of the ride. Boat access is highly recommended, as the wave starts in front of a large rivermouth almost a half-mile from the shore, currents can be strong, and having help if someone gets hurt. Due to Puerto Sandino's location, it picks up more swell than the nearby breaks, often producing sets that are several feet bigger. Its magic size is around eight-ten feet on the face. Although, due to the consistency of the sandbars, it can hold more size with the right swell direction and winds. The best time to surf this wave is the incoming tide push and with calm or light offshore winds. The ideal swell direction for Puerto Sandino is SSW, but does fine with S or SW too.

First, it's more of a flat slab of rock reef than a configuration of cobblestones, and the left is more similar to the Lowers right, while the right is more like the Lowers left.

A river flows out here and keeps the sandbar replenished. The surf tends to always be best from just on the north side to right in front of the river mouth. The south side of the river mouth is usually always walled out.

Colorados' perfection size is typically from around chest-shoulder high to 2-3 feet overhead (depending on sandbar quality and tide) -- anything bigger will usually wall out. Incoming sets will first bump up some on a reef way outside (which will even break on larger swells), before sinking back down then rising again at the lineup. The wave/peak can be quite shifty (which spreads out the crowd a little bit) with a fast peeling right, quite often with a hollow barrel. The lefts are usually a little less hollow than the rights, but still very racey, ripable, and hollow enough.

Colorados is best and most hollow on a low-mid to mid-high tide. On the peak higher tides, it becomes a bit backwashy and less hollow, and peak low tides can get drained out with bad rips. The best wind is obviously calm or light offshore (anything from north to east). Although Nica is known for the steady offshore flow due to Lake Nicaragua, sometimes it can blow a little too hard offshore. When these offshores are strong, you can often spot people getting pitched over the falls trying to get over the ledge.

The waves begin at Snapper, a gnarly outcrop of old lava rock set sideways to the line of coast; often they start with a dramatic, backwashy takeoff behind the rock, and run past another smaller outcrop known as Little Marley Point a couple hundred yards down the line before opening up into Rainbow Bay's deeper waters. Sometimes there's a slight degrading in the ride through this very long open-water section, but down the line you can see all the way to Kirra over a mile away, and directly in front looms the aptly named Greenmount Point. Greenmount leads the wave off for at least another 300 yards down toward Coolangatta Beach, where it finally semi-closes out before hitting the Kirra Big Groyne.Northerly sand flow toward and around Snapper Rocks is enhanced by river dredging from over a mile south, past the Tweed River; as a result, the sand storage through the bay is rich. A classic ritual is this: Ride a wave off the outside Snapper takeoff, connect it as far as possible, pick off another from wherever the first fizzles out, and keep connecting right through to Coolangatta Beach -- then walk the mile of beach and trail back to Snapper's jump-off zone just inside the rock line.On a good day, it's possible to count over true,000 surfers in the water along this amazing stretch. Yet the lineup is so broad and immense, the paddle so all-encompassing, that somehow the crowd takes care of itself, and after a few days' sustained swell battering, 75 percent have had enough. That's when the dawn patrol pays off. Around the corner, south of Snapper Rocks and Point Danger, lies the super-beachbreak of Duranbah. This super-consistent spot relies on a breakwall separating it from the mouth of the Tweed River; sand deposits outside the wall line tend to break up and refract incoming SE swells into juicy peaks, with short tube sections and ramps.",All Abilities,Beginner to advanced depending on size,Intimidating,"So many surfers it gets confusing, but the locals are confident, easy to spot, and only occasionally super heavy.

When Punta Roca and Tunco go flat, Mizata still has surf. It has about a half-mile of black-sand beach, giving it the feel of a private beach, yet boasts four breaks along that span. The Point is the most desired spot, with a right breaking best on the last hours of the dropping tide through the first couple hours on the rising tide. While not nearly as long a ride as its sister break, Punta Roca, it offers strong, fast drops with plenty of rideability. Its downside is it becomes almost unrideable over 8-10 feet due to the strong currents and the nearby cliff. Best size is anywhere from chest-high to well-overhead.Tweeners is in between the Point and the Beachbreak. It works best on a higher tide, due to more water over the rocks. Tweeners, especially on a S swell, has a left, as well. Next to it is the Beachbreak. Same swell as Tweeners, but no rocks, just a sandy bottom.

Swells will reflect off the long lava platform shelf on the south-end of the beach, right in front of Rancho Santana Resort. This reflecting energy will create a series of wedging peaks down the beach (usually a couple main peaks, but sometimes three or more, depending on swell). First and Second Peak are usually best and peakiest (as well as the most crowded). Furthermore, a river flows out right here, which keeps the sandbar replenished, but water can get quite dirty and with tree branches or whatnot after a significant rain. These peaks will offer fun, rippable lines, as well as some barrels that you can backdoor (especially off First Peak). The waves become less peaky and less crowded toward the north, with less interaction of swell reflection. But sometimes a good sandbar will set up down that way. Santana is best on mid to high tides for size, shape, and consistency. On lower tides, it becomes smaller, very dumpy, sectiony and drained out. It's pretty much a guarantee to always improve as the tide fills back in, unless winds turn onshore or swell drops out. The best wind is obviously calm or light offshore. Although Nicaragua is known for the steady offshore flow due to Lake Nicaragua, sometimes it can blow a little too hard offshore in this section of coast.",All Abilities,All levels -- Depends on size of course.

1203,Dungeons,Cape Peninsula,Cape Peninsula,South Africa,-34.0636,18.3387,Africa/Johannesburg,"Dungeons is a ferocious wave that, quite frankly, very few visiting surfers are going to surf. There are five main sections to the breaks, which have all been ridden to some degree:1. The Slab: The Slab comes into play when the swell is just a little bit too small to be ridden, and the tide is quite high. The Slab is the deepest sections of the wave and is a thick shelf that barrels properly but has a gnarly take-off and is probably best negotiated with Jet Ski.2. The Two-Point-Five: Two and a half meters deep, this part of the wave is also called the Photo Bowl. It is the widest section, breaks right in front of the cameras and is basically the end of the wave. Big, glorious waves can be caught and ridden here, and most shots of Dungeons are of people on the Two-Point-Five, but the bigger waves are to be found elsewhere.3. Washburn's Peak: Outside and deep. Less waves come here, but when they come they are the heat winners. When waiting for waves here you can see other surfers getting wave after wave on the Two-Point -Five. Very disconcerting.4. Outside Photo Bowl: When the swell gets big, straight and solid, the waves crack over the corner of the reef. Directly out from the Photo Bowl, these waves are very rare, and when they come they usually catch every one inside.5. The Left: Only surfed in marginal conditions, and usually by Jamie Sterling or surfers who have taken off too deep on the peak and can't get around. Go left, kick out and watch a set start building on Washburn's Peak and you'll experience true fear. And when it gets to 60-foot the waves break on different outside reefs altogether, but this hasn't really been studied much yet. Access to the break is generally gained by boat, and the wave is usually surfed with a safety crew around, but this doesn't stop accidents from happening. Dungeons is a serious wave with serious consequences and is only viable to the big wave-experienced surfers. Likes a wind with a bit of north in it but handles any light winds. Prefers a low tide, but when it gets giant no one really cares about the tide.",Advanced,Advanced,Welcoming,None really.,Mellow,"Either empty, or jammed during the events.

When the swell is hitting Sanur at six-feet or more, and the wind is offshore or glassy, and the tide is mid low-high, Sanur can be a world-class wave as good as anywhere - a long, bowling wave with multiple barrel sections breaking over ultra-sharp, living coral.

Although the best, biggest and most common swells are from the SW or SSW, Transito can also handle the occasional WNW swell during winter (as long as it's under 290 degrees). The best periods are anything from 16 seconds or under. Over 16 seconds and it tends to shut down, since the beach is fairly small. The extremely consistent El Transito break can be good all year round, just as long as it stays under a couple feet overhead. This spot is usually pretty fun in the offseason (November to March), as the swells are usually smaller during that time of year and more suitable for the break. There is a small point on the south end of the beach (similar to Machete Point at Playa Maderas) with a rock/sand bottom that works on mid-period SSW swells. The wave on the main beach (sand bottom) is typically mellow, with softer barrel sections and medium-length waves suitable for all levels of surfers. El Transito is best from waist-high to about one-foot overhead and on a mid-tide, however, it will break on most tides. The tide swings here are drastic, so the peaks will often change completely. The predominant offshore winds (250+ days/year) are best from the E-NE. These offshores rarely get too strong here as it's further north (so hardly ever any upwelling). There are other breaks within walking distance or a short boat ride. Hemmies (if you dare) is a 15-minute boat ride to the south. About a 30-minute boat trip to the north, there is the increasingly popular break of Puerto Sandino, which is one of the longer lefts in Nicaragua, offering about 300-yard rides on the best days.

Conchalio is tricky to score since it picks up most anything coming in from the South Pacific and can become torn to pieces between spring and autumn (rainy season), when the winds clock onshore without fail every day around noon. In fact, the best time to give it a look is during late autumn through winter (dry season), when offshore winds really open up the barrels and provide clean exits.Playa Conchalio is a rather local stretch of coastline with just a few small hotels and hostels to choose from. The lack of tourism infrastructure is a bonus for those seeking an infusion of culture in their surf trip, as well as fairly uncrowded surf. Nevertheless, surfing has become woven into the fabric of coastal Salvadorian life since traveling gringo surfers introduced the sport to nearby Sunzal and Punta Roca in the 1970s, so you'll be sharing the waves with plenty of talented locals.

At that size, there's nowhere to hide when long-line sets charge into the lineup, mowing down anyone caught too far inside. You won't hit the bottom (unless you're caught inside on the righthander), but the undiluted power of the place is going to hold you down for a while. But sit far enough out and have the ability to catch one of these beasts, and you will find yourself in command of a long, charging wall, peeling easily into a long, deep channel on the left, or throwing fast sections on the right, which eventually closes out in front of dry reef.
